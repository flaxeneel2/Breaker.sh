A pterodactyl multi egg that I am making in order to learn more about making multi eggs.
This will likely contain bad code since I do not do bash scripts in general.
This egg is not meant for commercial use and if you do use it. I will not take any responsibility for issues faced in a production environment with this egg.

#### NOTE:
This is purely for a learning experience for both myself and anyone else interested in making multi eggs.

To the people who are just going to skid this: Just don't, it would be more logical to just make your own. This is not meant for commercial use, therefore it is not optimized that well.
